## Interview Q's
Q: AMZN - What's the use of AUC  
AUC represents the probability that a random positive (green) example is positioned to the right of a random negative (red) example.  
AUC is desirable for the following two reasons:  
* AUC is scale-invariant. It measures how well predictions are ranked, rather than their absolute values.
* AUC is classification-threshold-invariant. It measures the quality of the model's predictions irrespective of what classification threshold is chosen.
